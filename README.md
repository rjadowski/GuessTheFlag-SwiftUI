# Guess the Flag
This is a simple game built using SwiftUI where you have to guess the flag of a country from a set of options. You will be presented with four flags and you have to tap on the flag which you think is the correct answer. You will be awarded one point for every correct answer and the game ends after seven questions.

# Usage
You can download or clone this repository and open the project in Xcode. The app is built using SwiftUI and can be run on any device with iOS 14 or later.

When you run the app, you will be presented with a screen with four flags. Tap on the flag which you think is the correct answer. If you are correct, you will be awarded one point and the score will be displayed on the screen. If you are wrong, the correct answer will be displayed and you will not be awarded any points.

After every question, the options will be shuffled and a new set of flags will be displayed. The game ends after seven questions and your final score will be displayed on the screen.
